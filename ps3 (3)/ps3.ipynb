    "## Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's apply the support vector machine we learnt in lecture to the credit card dataset. Here is a quick recap of what SVM is about: We are given a training dataset of $n$ points of the form $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, where the $y^{(i)}$ are labels, each indicating the class to which the point $x^{(i)}$ belongs. Typically, the SVM is formulated with $y^{(i)}$ being either 1 or -1, however the following discussion uses equivalently $y^{(i)}$ being either 1 or 0. Be careful that some examples in this problem use data with 1,0 and some examples use data with 1,-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each $x^{(i)}$ $n$-dimensional real vector. We want to find the \"maximum-margin hyperplane\" that divides the group of points $x^{(i)}$ for which $y_{i}=1$ from the group of points for which $y_{i}=0$, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point $x^{(i)}$ from either group is maximized.\n",

    "<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\">Figure 14: Visualisation of support vector machine.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we do construct such a \"maximum-margin hyperplane\"? Recall that in the lecture, we formulated soft-margin SVMs as the following minimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{w} C \\left[\\sum_{i = 1}^{m} y^{(i)}\\ Cost_1(\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\ Cost_0(\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\\right] + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\mathbf{w}_i^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Cost_1(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \\max(0, 1 - \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ and $Cost_0(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \\max(0, 1 + \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$, with the hypothesis function $h_\\mathbf{w}(\\mathbf{w}) = 1$ if $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the summand term is known as the *hinge loss*. Thus, when $y^{(i)} = 0$, the more negative $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ is, the more $Cost_1$ penalises the model. Similarly, $Cost_0$ penalises the model the further $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ strays from the negative region. Notice how the cost function aligns with the goal of the hypothesis function? Additional note: $Cost_0 = Cost_{-1}$, where $Cost_{-1}$ was used in the lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we also add a regularization parameter $C$ to the cost function to balance the trade-off between margin maximization and loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, solving this minimization problem allows us to find the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ that provides the maximum-margin hyperplane while balancing the trade-off of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this set up in mind, how can we implement this in code? Thankfully, with modern machine learning libraries, much of the tedious work of solving this minimization problem has been done. As machine learning practitioners, one popular library that we commonly use (aside from [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)) is [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), which is built on top of NumPy and provides simple and efficient tools to implement common machine learning algorithms.\n",
