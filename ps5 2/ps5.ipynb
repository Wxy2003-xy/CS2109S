    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, while fundamentals are welcomed and appreciated, implementing algorithms from scratch is time consuming, especially when it comes to Deep Learning (DL) models like neural networks with many layers. Backpropagating manually or by hand is often tedious and erroneous. Which is why, it is absolutely critical to learn **at least one** Machine Learning library, either to get jobs or build projects in this field. As such, in *Problem Set 5*, we will introduce you to **PyTorch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PyTorch](images/logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "`PyTorch` is one of the most widely-used DL library. It offers a very Pythonic API to build layers and compose them together. In fact, data processing is also made easy using the multitude of tools and wrappers that are at your disposal. Of course, there are other popular libraries such as `TensorFlow`, but they require you to understand \"computation graphs\", which we feel makes it less accessible for beginners. Hence, we decided to use PyTorch for CS2109S. \n",
    "\n",
    "In *Problem Set 5*, we will attempt to help you learn the `PyTorch` API by having you build a simple deep neural network and training it locally on your system via backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. You will also learn how to build data processing pipelines to prepare your data before ingestion into your model(s). Subsequently, you will be building a __Convolutional Neural Network__ (CNN/ConvNet) and training it on two datasets, *MNIST* and *CIFAR-10*. You'll also learn how to build __data augmentation pipelines__ to enhance your dataset. We will then learn the details of RNN, as well as their applications to sequential data. Lastly, we will use an RNN to model and predict patterns in time-series data, specifically using sine wave."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Activation functions introduces non-linearity into the output of a neuron, allowing the NN to learn non-linear functions. Without non-linearity, our entire network will effectively become a linear model with only one layer, preventing us from modelling complex representations based on our inputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "####  For the hidden layers, there are several commonly used activation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): ReLU is a popular activation function that is widely used in deep learning models. It maps non-positive inputs to 0 and positive inputs to their original value. It is mainly used in hidden layers because it is fast to compute, has sparse activations, and helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients can become very small and cause the model to learn slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Tanh is a activation function that maps input values to the range [-1, 1]. It is similar to Sigmoid, but instead of producing output values in the range [0, 1], it produces output values in the range [-1, 1]. Tanh is useful for solving problems where you want the activations to be centered around zero, such as in recurrent neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid: Sigmoid maps its input values to the range [0, 1]. It is less commonly used in hidden layers because it has a relatively slow convergence rate and can introduce saturation, where the output values become very small or very large, which can make it difficult for the gradients to flow through the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the output layer, the choice of activation function depends on the problem you're trying to solve. Here are some common choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid: The Sigmoid activation function maps input values to the range [0, 1]. It is commonly used for binary classification problems where the network produces a probability of one of two classes. In this case, the Sigmoid activation maps the output to a probability distribution over the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax: The Softmax activation function is a generalization of the Sigmoid activation that maps input values to a probability distribution over multiple classes. It is commonly used for multiclass classification problems. The Softmax activation function is used to convert the raw scores produced by the network into a probability distribution over the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear: For regression problems, the linear activation function is often used because it just maps the input values to the output values without any change.\n",
    "\n",

We can see that the derivatives for both Sigmoid and Tanh tend to zero when the inputs are largely positive or negative, while derivative for ReLU is zero only when the inputs are non-positive. In our neural network, gradients are calculated through backpropagation using chain rule and the derivatives of each layer are multiplied down the network. The gradient is more likely to decrease exponentially as we propagate down to the initial layers if we use Sigmoid and Tanh as compared to ReLU, leading to the vanishing gradient problem._\n",

    "## Concept 5.2: Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dropout__ (*Srivastava et al., 2014*) is a regularisation technique that randomly shuts off neurons in a given layer. This means the output of the neuron is __zero__. As users, we need to specify a probability value `p` that is the probability of a neuron being shut off or not; there's a $p$ chance of a neuron being shut off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a layer has $n$ neurons/units. Mathematically, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Prob}(i = 1) = p \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Prob}(i = 0) = 1 - p\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $1$ represents neuron $i$ being shut off and $0$ represents neuron $0$ left untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Dropout does this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://production-media.paperswithcode.com/methods/Screen_Shot_2020-05-23_at_6.19.24_PM.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Dropout works\n",
    "By randomly dropping/zero-ing out neurons in a layer, it has a regularising effect on the model. It prevents overfitting because the loss of certain features means the model doesn't accidentally compute very complex functions to model the relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout in PyTorch\n",
    "To use Dropout in a network, we can create a `Dropout` layer in our `__init__` method of the model class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Model(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, ..., drop_prob):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.l1 = ...\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=drop_prob)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        self.ln = ...\n",
    "   \n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        x = self.l1(x)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        x = self.dropout(x)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        out = ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return out\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ Other that `nn.Dropout`, there is a `nn.Dropout2d` in PyTorch. Instead of randomly zero-ing out neurons, `Dropout2d` randomly zero-es out the entire channels of the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "`nn.Dropout` is best used with non-spatial data or data that has been flattened, which is typical for fully connected layers. `nn.Dropout2d` is designed for spatial data, making it ideal for use right after convolutional and pooling layers in CNNs.\n",
