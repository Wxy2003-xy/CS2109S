    "Python is the most common language used for modern AI applications. Modern machine learning also often involves linear algebra. We will not be teaching either Python or linear algebra explictly in CS2109S. Instead, we have designed this problem set to help you to become familiar with Python and review (or learn) some fundamental matrix operations. We will also learn how to use some useful functions in NumPy, a Python package that allows us to easily manipulate multidimensional arrays (like vectors and matrices).\n",

    "This problem set will not be fully comprehensive. There will likely still be more things that you will need to learn on your own. However, this is a feature and not a bug. The high-level goal of CS2109S is to learn how to learn new things on your own! However, this problem set will hopefully be a helpful primer for your learning journey.\n",

Instead, please work with the operations available in NumPy. \n",

For example, [np.vectorize](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.vectorize.html) is not allowed since it is iterative. From NumPy's documentation, it states that \"The vectorize function is provided primarily for convenience, not for performance. The implementation is essentially a for loop.\", which is clearly iterative.\n",

If you are in doubt about an unlisted function, please ask in the forum. **Solutions that violate this will be heavily penalised**."

You should also check out the detailed description [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.nan_to_num.html) because there are many functions of the same nature.
